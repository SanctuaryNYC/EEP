#### Your experience is important.

# We use your feedback to ensure Sanctuary programs are effective.

We ask you to complete a survey so that we can get candid, honest feedback about our program. We also want to better understand how our program has impacted your life.
 
Your responses will be **confidential** and will not have any impact on your future experience with staff, your standing within in the program, or future services. EEP staff will not see your individual responses.  Your responses will be viewed by the Program Evaluation team (not affiliated with EEP) and aggregated together before being shared back with EEP.
