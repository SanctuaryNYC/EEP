#### Your experience is important.

# We use your feedback to ensure Sanctuary programs are effective.

By filling out a survey, we can evaluate how programs impact the lives of those they serve. Your responses will be **confidential** and will not have any impact on your future experience with staff, standing within in the program, or future services.  **We do not ask for your name, email address, or any other identifying information.** The program evaluation team has a significant degree of independence from the Economic Empowerment Program and is responsible for advocating for your interests.
